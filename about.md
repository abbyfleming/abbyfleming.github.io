Hello! I'm Abby. I reclaimed my weekends after photographing weddings for 8 years in the mountains of North Carolina. In 2016, I spent six months at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) in Cohort 16 learning JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, and Django.

Photographing well over a hundred weddings, I learned a few things along the way: 
* There is beauty in the tiny details
* The story must naturally unfold
* but schedules and clear communication are key
* Pivot, and pivot fast!

I bring the same passion and mindset to work. For me, coding is a craft and I strive to bring clarity and detail to my code. I advocate lovingly and relentlessly for end users.

### The best work days...
Are spent working closely with project managers, UI/UX developers, and walking through the data with teammates. Creating reusable components is my jam and I love getting my hands on new designs.

### I frequently work with:
* JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular 6+, Ionic 3 & 4, Vue
* HTML, CSS, Sass, Sass Architecture 
* Bootstrap 3 & 4, Bulma, Custom theming
* PHP, Laravel, MySQL

### ...and a little less often:
* Python, Django, Locust (Load testing)
* Exposure to C#, .NET, MVC

## Elsewhere
* Musings on code and mental health on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/abbyleighanneco) 
* Current project list on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbyfleming/)
* Older projects on [Github](https://www.github.com/abbyfleming)
