Hello! I'm Abby. I reclaimed my weekends after photographing weddings for 8 years in the mountains of North Carolina. In 2016, I spent six months at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) in Cohort 16 learning JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, and Django.

Photographing well over a hundred weddings, I learned a few things along the way:

- There is beauty in the tiny details
- The story must naturally unfold
- but schedules and clear communication are key
- Pivot, and pivot fast!

I bring the same passion and mindset to work. For me, coding is a craft and I strive to bring clarity and detail to my code. I advocate lovingly and relentlessly for end users.

### The best work days...

Are spent working closely with project managers, UI/UX designers, and walking through the data with teammates. Creating reusable components is my jam and I love getting my hands on new designs.

### I've worked with:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular 2+, Ionic 3 & 4
- Ruby, Rails
- HTML, CSS, Sass, Sass Architecture
- Bootstrap 3 & 4, Bulma, Custom theming

### ...and a little less often:

- Vue, React
- Python, Django, Locust (Load testing)
- PHP, Laravel, MySQL
- Exposure to C#, .NET, MVC
