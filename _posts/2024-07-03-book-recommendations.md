### Guiding Thoughts üå±

Let's face it. 
Sometimes technical & business books are _boring_.
I'm usually at a coffee shop and wondering why nobody else is reading algorithms for fun. ü•¥

For me, progress is often:

- one chapter at a time
- writing notes in the margins
- highlighting sections
- deeply questioning the _why_
- learning to disagree and move on (I've resorted to drawing frowny faces in my books)

That said, these books _have_ helped me grow. 
Even if it's just one tiny concept out of a large book.

I hope this list helps start your reading journey.
I've marked my favorite (üëç) and least favorite (üëé) in each section. YMMV. Take it with a grain of salt.
Some books are in progress (üìñ).
If you have read one of these, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Quick thoughts:

- Dare to Lead & Extreme Ownership pair well together. Similar concepts with different perspectives.
- I've tried to read The First 90 Days twice. I haven't made it past 20% either time.
- Five Dysfunctions is a quick read. However, I would _not_ recommend telling other people how they are dysfunctional unless you've built trust and it's a safe space. I talked about this book in therapy for weeks.

### Habits / Growth

- [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) üëç

- [Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career](https://www.amazon.com/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate/dp/006285268X)

Quick Thoughts:

We often joked that the Atomic Habits, Deep Work, and Ultralearning authors are probably BFFs. 
Atomic Habits is the most approachable and realistic.

### Technology / Product

Quick Thoughts:

- 99 Bottles fundamentally changed the way I look at code. Well worth the read.
- If you're in the product world, Inspired is a thoughtful read. I've learned how to ask better questions because of this book.
- Transparently, I haven't finished Design Patterns or Clean Code. I had mixed feelings about Clean Code, so it gets a üëé until/if I finish.
- You Don't Know JS made me question everything I know about JS. Proceed with caution.

### Miscellaneous
