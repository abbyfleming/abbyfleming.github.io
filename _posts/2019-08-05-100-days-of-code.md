## Log

* Day 001: 
  * 22/22 lessons completed from Free Code Camp's [Applied Accessibility Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility)
  * 8/18 lessons completed from Free Code Camp's [Object Oriented Programming Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming)
  * Thoughts: It's easy to get caught up in frameworks and forget the importance of semantic HTML. I'm looking forward to diving into HTML5 tags a bit more and improve accessibility.

* Day 002:
    * 18/18 lessons completed from Free Code Camp's [Object Oriented Programming Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming)
    * Watched [Object-oriented Programming in 7 minutes, Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8)
    * Definition to remember: Object -  A group of related variables and functions. We call that group/unit an _object_. We refer to the variables as _properties_ and the functions as _methods_.
