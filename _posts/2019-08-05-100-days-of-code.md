The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on August 5, 2019.

## Rules
The main rule: Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

> 10/8 - Update: I'm coming to terms that I can't dedicate an hour every day to this project. (There's been big projects at work lately!) Even though I'm not spending an hour a day on this, I do want to continue making updates as I make them. ðŸ˜Œ

Learn more about the main rules, as well as some other considerations.
* Code for minimum an hour a day
* Tweet your progress daily with the hashtag: #100DaysOfCode
* Each day, reach out to at least two people on Twitter who are also doing the challenge

## Log

### Days 1-10:

* Day 001: 
  * 22/22 lessons completed from Free Code Camp's [Applied Accessibility Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility)
  * 8/18 lessons completed from Free Code Camp's [Object Oriented Programming Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming)
  * Thoughts: It's easy to get caught up in frameworks and forget the importance of semantic HTML. I'm looking forward to diving into HTML5 tags a bit more and improve accessibility.

* Day 002:
    * 18/18 lessons completed from Free Code Camp's [Object Oriented Programming Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming)
    * Watched [Object-oriented Programming in 7 minutes, Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8)
    * Definition to remember: Object -  A group of related variables and functions. We call that group/unit an _object_. We refer to the variables as _properties_ and the functions as _methods_.
    * Started reading: [Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2) by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin

* Day 003:
    * Completed NSS Exercise: [The toString Version of You](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-3-the-initiate/chapters/JS_OBJECT_CREATE.md)
    * Github: [See the exercise code](https://github.com/abbyfleming/refresher/tree/master/oop/the-tostring-version-of-you)
    * Important to remember: Passing in `null` or an empty object `{}` in `Object.create()`, produces vastly different results. Study this more!

* Day 004:
    * Completed NSS Exercise: [Financial Advisor](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-3-the-initiate/chapters/JS_OBJECT_CREATE.md) along with the challenge: Advisor.toString()
    * Github: [See the exercise code](https://github.com/abbyfleming/refresher/tree/master/oop/financial-advisor)
    * Attended a meetup! 

* Day 005:
    * Completed [Financial Advisor](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/client-side-mastery/blob/master/book-3-the-initiate/chapters/JS_OBJECT_CREATE.md) challenge: Fragments and Elements
    * Helpful Resources: YouTube Video, [Creating Dynamic HTML Derived from a JSON Response Using Document Fragments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcbS7W34D0E)
    * Definition to remember: DocumentFragment - A minimal document object that has no parent. It's used as a lightweight version of `document`. Since it's not part of the active document tree, changes do not impact performance. This allows us to build up the document and place it into the DOM at once.

    * Definition to remember: DOM - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. [Source: MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)


* Day 006:
    * 17/52 lessons completed from Free Code Camp's [Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design)
    * Attended a meetup!
    * Continued reading: [Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2) by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin


* Day 007:
    * Began working on a personal side project using [Nashville Open Data - Community Resource Info](https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Community-Resource-Information/ekvg-j2ns). My goals are:
        * Clean up the data (in increments) and create an API using Laravel. 
        * Display the data in an intuitive meaningful way. I'm still determining the front end, but I'm leaning towards Angular and/or Ionic.
    * Created a Trello board to track progress: [https://trello.com/b/XXBHZ71c/community-resources](https://trello.com/b/XXBHZ71c/community-resources)
    * Install day! I spent the majority of my time upgrading PHP, installing MAMP, composer, and Laravel
    * The project can be found here: [https://github.com/abbyfleming/community-resources](https://github.com/abbyfleming/community-resources)

* Day 008:
    * Laravel is up and running!
    * Using migrations, I created a table `community_csv` which holds all the data. I wanted all the data dumped in a table for a few reasons:
        * I can run basic SQL queries and determine where to start (small wins first!)
        * I wanted to have experience moving data from `.csv` files to a SQL table.
    * I found this tutorial ['How to import CSV data to local database in Laravel'](https://justlaravel.com/import-csv-data-store-database/?utm_source=learninglaravel.net#step1) to be incredibly helpful! 
    * I've started working on an initial ERD along with data cleanup
    * The project can be found here: [https://github.com/abbyfleming/community-resources](https://github.com/abbyfleming/community-resources)

* Day 009:
    * I'm continuing to work through the data that I've been able to pull into `community_csv`.
    * I'm becoming more confident in seeding data from existing tables and I'm currently working on seeding the `service_locations` table. I used a regex in a `preg_replace` to remove the latitude & longitude for now. Many migrations, many rollbacks, many seedings.

* Day 010:
    * I'm continuing to work through the data that I've been able to pull into `community_csv`. `services` table is now populated with data & foreign keys. There's some refactoring I'd like to do, but this has been a good start!

### Days 11-20:
I've finished reading: [Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2) by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. I'm currently working on [Dare to Lead](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/) by BrenÃ© Brown.

* Day 011:
    * Today, I pulled the latitude & longitude out of the `mapped_location` column into their own columns. This took quite a bit of work since I'm unfamiliar with some of PHP's syntax & there were some regex(s) involved. 
    * I'm really happy that these values have been pulled out. This can allow me to possibly use an API service to pass in the lat/long in the future to return zip codes, which many of the locations are missing!
